### Explanation:
1. **Keyboard Navigation Component**: The `KeyboardNavigation` component encapsulates the keyboard navigation logic and is reusable across different parts of the application. It requires a CSS selector string to identify focusable elements.
  
2. **Event Handling**: It listens for keydown events and navigates through the focusable elements using arrow keys while also handling Home and End keys. Proper event prevention is included to avoid default behavior.

3. **Cleanup**: The event listener is removed when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

4. **Application Structure**: The main `App` component demonstrates how to use the `KeyboardNavigation` component and includes a few interactive elements for testing.

5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Focus styles are provided in CSS to enhance visibility for keyboard users.

6. **Error Handling**: The root element's existence is checked when rendering the application, throwing an error if not found, which is a good practice for avoiding runtime issues.
