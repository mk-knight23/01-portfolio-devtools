### Explanation of Code:
1. **Service Worker**: The service worker is implemented in `service-worker.ts` and utilizes Workbox to simplify caching strategies. It listens for the install and activate events to manage caches.
2. **Precache**: The `precaching.precacheAndRoute` function makes it easy to cache assets defined in the `__WB_MANIFEST` during the service worker's installation.
3. **Cache Strategy**: The `CacheFirst` strategy is employed for requests that are documents, scripts, or styles, ensuring quick responses from the cache when available.
4. **Fallback for Offline**: The service worker handles fetch events and provides a fallback offline page if the network is unavailable.
5. **Service Worker Registration**: The service worker is registered in `index.ts`, with proper error handling to provide feedback in case of failure.
6. **Offline Page**: An `offline.html` page is provided as a user-friendly message when the app is offline. 

Make sure to include Workbox in your project dependencies to use the above code effectively.
