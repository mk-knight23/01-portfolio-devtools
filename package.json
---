### Explanation:

1. **Modular Design**: The code is divided into separate components (`FormBuilder` and `FormField`). This makes the codebase easier to manage and extend.
2. **State Management**: The form fields are managed using React's `useState` hook, ensuring the UI updates reactively based on user actions.
3. **Export Functionality**: A `Blob` is used to create a downloadable JSON file when exporting the form configuration, with error handling for robustness.
4. **TypeScript**: Types are defined for props and state, which helps with type safety and reduces runtime errors.
5. **Edge Case Handling**: The export function includes a try-catch block to handle potential errors gracefully.
